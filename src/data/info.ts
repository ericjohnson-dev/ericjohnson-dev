  about: `<p>I started my development journey as a kid tinkering around with desktop applications using BASIC and C++, setting lofty goals of becoming a mastermind hacker. As luck would have it, there weren't a lot of resources available for youngsters seeking a life of digital crime, and my ambitions started to wane. With the rise of MySpace as the go-to way to socialize online, I shifted my attention towards having the most unique page possible, and with that shift I stumbled into the world of web development.</p><p>In high school I took an internship at Collaboration Reverberation, a full service branding agency, and found myself in a position to shape the direction the web development department took. Sites built with Dreamweaver and Flash were on their way out, and I began to slowly modernize their development stack with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a PHP powered backend.</p><p>Over the next 15 years I assembled a team of local and remote developers, designed hosting infrastructure from scratch, and architected and implemented a modern CI/CD pipeline.</>`,
