  about: `<p>I started my development journey as a kid tinkering around with desktop applications using BASIC and C++, having lofty goals of becoming a mastermind hacker. As luck would have it, there weren't a lot of resources available for youngsters seeking a life of digital crime, and my ambitions started to lose steam. With the rise of MySpace as the go-to way to socialize online, I shifted my attention towards having the most unique page possible, and with that shift I stumbled into the world of web development.</p><p>In high school I took an internship at Collaboration Reverberation, a full service branding agency, and promptly took over web development. Sites built in Dreamweaver and with Flash were on their way out, and I took the initiative to move their client sites to more modern web development tools and methodologies. Over the next 15 years I put together a team of local and remote developers, built our hosting infrastructure from scratch, and architected and implemented a development pipeline.</>`,
